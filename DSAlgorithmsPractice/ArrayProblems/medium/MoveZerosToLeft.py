"""
Given an integer array, move all elements that are 0 to the left while maintaining
the order of other elements in the array. The array has to be modified in-place.

Letâ€™s look at the following integer array:

[1,10,20,0,59,63,0,88,0]

After moving all zeros to the left, the array should like this:
[0,0,0,1,10,20,59,63,88]

Remember to maintain the order of non-zero elements
